# Temperature control system
The major purpose of the temperature control system is to keep a car seat at a comfortable temperature. When a passenger or driver enters the vehicle, the button sensor is activated. The user can then activate the heating system. The temperature sensor measures the temperature continuously and sends the analogue value to the microcontroller. The analogue input from the temperature sensor is processed by the microcontroller, which subsequently generates a temperature reading over a serial connection. An Atmega328 microprocessor oversees the whole operation of the control system.
