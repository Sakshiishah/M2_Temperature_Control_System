## Fumctionality
* The first LED illuminates when the two switches are closed, signalling that the system and heater have been activated.
* The temperature sensor's analogue input is then received and digitised.
* Pulse Width Modulation is used to show the digital temperature input.
* The UART protocol transmits the corresponding temperature data based on the digital temperature input. The data is presented on the serial monitor in this location.
