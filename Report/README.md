# M2_Temperature_Control_System
## Theory
The primary function of the heat control system is to regulate the temperature of a car seat. The button sensor is engaged when a user or driver of the car sits in the vehicle. The user then has the ability to turn on the heating. The temperature sensor continuously measures the temperature and transmits the analogue value to the microcontroller. The temperature sensor's analogue input is processed by the microcontroller, which then produces a temperature reading via serial connection. The control system's whole operation is controlled by an Atmega328 microprocessor.

## Components used
### Atmega328
Atmel's megaAVR series includes the ATmega328, a single-chip microcontroller. It has an 8-bit RISC processing core based on Harvard architecture.

### Communication Protocol 
The Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter, or UART, is a serial communication device that converts parallel to serial data at the transmitter and serial to parallel data at the receiver. It is ubiquitous because it has changeable settings such as transfer speed, data speed, and so on.
