# Temperature Control Sysytem
## Description
One of the most important aspects of our project is monitoring. This technology is utilised to determine the passenger's existence, and if the passenger is present, our machine begins to evolve its functionality. So, in recent years, everything has become digitised, and everyone is looking for new products to make their lives easier. The main goal of our project is to design and expand a machine that can track the passenger's life as well as monitor and display heat.
## Features

* If a passenger is present inside the vehicle, it will give the signal.
* The heat will be decided after the indication.
* The driver and the passenger may have access to changing the temperature inside the vehicle.
Because the presentation is supplied within the system, the passenger can change the temperature by glancing at the show.
## Components used
### Atmega328
Atmel's megaAVR series includes the ATmega328, a single-chip microcontroller. It has an 8-bit RISC processing core based on Harvard architecture.

### Communication Protocol 
The Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter, or UART, is a serial communication device that converts parallel to serial data at the transmitter and serial to parallel data at the receiver. It is ubiquitous because it has changeable settings such as transfer speed, data speed, and so on.

### Software Used
* SimulIde
SimulIDE is an electronic circuit simulator that runs in real time. It's a straightforward tool for advanced learning that also allows you to enjoy the process. SimulIDE is a simple electronics simulator that is supposed to be quick and easy to use. AVR, Arduino, and PIC microcontrollers are available in SimulIDE and can be accessed in the same way as other components. Gpsim and simavr are features that allow you to use PIC and AVR microcontrollers, respectively.

* Winavr 
WinAVR is a collection of open-source software development tools for the Atmel AVR series of RISC microprocessors running on Windows. It comes with the GNU GCC C and C++ compiler.

## 4W's and 1'H
### Who:
* End Users will be in any sort of vehicles

### What:
* It will monitor the analog value of temperature and we can also control the temperature as per the users need.
### Where:
* This will be particularly useful in  main focus is automobile industry.
### How:
* The button sensor is turned on. The user then has the ability to turn on the heating. The temperature sensor continuously measures the temperature and transmits the analogue value to the microcontroller.

## Features
* Its able to figuring out climate the consumer is exist or now no longer withinside the
automobile
* If Passanger turned into existed withinside the automobile it's going to offers the
indication. 
* Driver and the passanger could have the get entry to to chaning the temperature
withinside the automobile. 
* The passanger can alternate the temperature via way of means of looking the show
because the show is given withinside the system 
## SWOT Analysis 
### Strengths
* Easy to adjust the temperature value. 

* The machine is robust. 
* Low cost. 

* Modular Based Programs. 
### Weakness
* It's handiest beneficial for the international locations which might be having low
temperature. 
### Opportunities
* It can be practised by replacing heater by air conditioners so that it will be usefull in all the
countries
### Threats 
* Not suitable for average or high temperature environment
*
